# Ingredient-to-Recipe-Generator
Food is a vital part of a personâ€™s health and well-being which is crucial for maintaining a good
mental and physical state of the body. The common problem that has plagued us is that sometimes
it is tough to choose what we need to cook based on the ingredients available. There are a lot of
ingredients available which can be used in different combinations to make numerous kinds of food
fit for consumption. Our project aims to implement a system where we use deep learning
algorithms as RNN and LSTM to suggest recipes to users based on the ingredients
that has been given by the users. The recipe generation will be done by utilizing a model which
comprises a neural network. The main aspect of recipe generation lies in the ingredients that are
sourced and will play a key role in generation of recipes.
